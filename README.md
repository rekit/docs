# Getting Started with Rekit

## Packages

Rekit contains several packages: `rekit`, `rekit-core`, `rekit-studio`, `rekit-app`.

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```

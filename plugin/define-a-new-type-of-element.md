# Define a New Type of Element

## Steps

1. Define element structure
2. Define add/move/remove operations on element
3. Provide menu items to context menu
4. Define form fields to add an element
5. Show element in diagram
6. Define the views to manage the element
7. 
```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
